# Ex.No: 1(C) LOOPING STATEMENT

## QUESTION:
A left-aligned triangle pattern is a pattern of stars (*) where each row contains an increasing number of stars, aligned to the left side.

Write a Java program that:

Prompts the user to enter the number of rows for the triangle.

Uses nested loops to print the left-aligned triangle pattern.

Ensures that each row contains stars corresponding to its row number.


## AIM:
To print a left-aligned triangle pattern is a pattern of stars (*) where each row contains an increasing number of stars, aligned to the left side.

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
   
2.	Import the necessary package 'java.util'
     
4.	The program asks the user to type in a number and stores it in the rows variable. This number will be the total height of the triangle.

5. The program starts a loop that controls the rows (lines). It uses a counter i, which starts at 1 and will continue as long as i is less than or equal to the rows number.

6. Inside the main loop, another loop begins. This one controls what is printed on the current line. It uses a counter j, which starts at 1 and continues as long as j is less than or equal to the current value of i.

7. Inside this inner loop, the program prints one asterisk and a space ("* "). This step will repeat i times (e.g., on row 3, it prints 3 asterisks).

8. When the inner loop (Step 4 and 5) is completely finished for that row, the program prints a newline. This moves the printing to the start of the next line.

9. The program goes back to Step 3 to start the next row (by increasing i by 1). This whole process repeats until i is greater than rows.

10. Close the scanner object and end the program.

## SOURCE CODE:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ReverseNumber {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int rows = sc.nextInt();

        for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                System.out.print("* ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
